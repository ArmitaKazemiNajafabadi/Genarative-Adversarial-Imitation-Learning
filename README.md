# GAIL Pipeline Implementation [files not added]

Clean, modular implementation of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) using the [HumanCompatibleAI/imitation](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation) library.

**Under Development**
---
For environments without pre-trained HuggingFace experts, custom expert training will be added in future versions.

**Currently tested environments**:
---
- `CartPole-v0` ✅
- `HalfCheetah-v1` ✅ (requires `gymnasium[mujoco]`)

---
## Features

- **Pre-trained Expert Loading**: Automatically loads pre-trained experts from HuggingFace
- **Vectorized Environments**: Parallel environment execution for faster training
- **Modular Pipeline**: Clear separation of setup → expert loading → demonstration collection → GAIL training
- **CLI Interface**: Easy configuration without code changes
- **Vector Observations Only**: Supports standard Gym environments (CartPole, HalfCheetah, etc.)

## CLI Parameters

### Environment & Basic Settings

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--env` | `CartPole-v0` | Gym environment name (CartPole-v0) |
| `--seed` | `42` | Random seed for reproducibility |
| `--n-envs` | `8` | Number of parallel environments |

### Demonstration Collection

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--demo-episodes` | `60` | Number of expert episodes to collect for training dataset |

**What it means:** More episodes = better representation of expert behavior, but diminishing returns after ~100 episodes.

### GAIL Training

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--gail-steps` | `100000` | Total training timesteps for GAIL |
| `--demo-batch-size` | `2048` | Batch size for demonstration samples |
| `--gen-buffer-capacity` | `512` | Generator replay buffer capacity |
| `--n-disc-updates` | `16` | Discriminator updates per training round |

**Minimum timesteps:** `gen-buffer-capacity × n-disc-updates` (default: 512 × 16 = 8,192)

### Evaluation

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--n-eval-episodes` | `100` | Number of episodes for performance evaluation |

**What it means:** Used only for measuring reward before/after training. More episodes = more accurate estimate.

# Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Test Run

Test GAIL with minimal training:

```bash
python gail_pipeline.py --env CartPole-v0 --gail-steps 50000 --demo-episodes 30
```
```bash
python gail_pipeline.py --env HalfCheetah-v1 --gail-steps 50000 --demo-episodes 30
```

**Use case:** Fast prototyping, debugging, or verifying setup works.

### Example 2: Full Training to Match Expert

Train until the learner matches the expert performance:

```bash
python gail_pipeline.py --env CartPole-v0 --gail-steps 2500000 --demo-episodes 100
```

**Expected results:**
- Expert reward: ~500
- Learner before: ~40-100
- Learner after: ~450-500

```bash
python gail_pipeline.py --env HalfCheetah-v1 --gail-steps 2000000 --demo-episodes 100
```
**Expected results:**
- Expert reward: ~1630-1710
- Learner before: ~0
- Learner after: ~1000-1710


**Use case:** Production-quality imitation learning.

### Example 3: Custom GAIL Configuration 

Adjust GAIL hyperparameters:

```bash
python gail_pipeline.py \
    --seed 32
    --n-envs 10
    --env CartPole-v0 \
    --gail-steps 500000 \
    --demo-batch-size 1024 \
    --gen-buffer-capacity 2048 \
    --n-disc-updates 8
```

**Note:** Minimum timesteps becomes 2048 × 8 = 16,384

**Use case:** Hyperparameter tuning for specific environments.

### Example 4: More Parallel Environments [Not Tested]

Speed up training with more parallel environments:

```bash
python gail_pipeline.py --env CartPole-v0 --n-envs 16 --gail-steps 1000000
```

**Use case:** Faster training on multi-core systems.

# Understanding the Output

### Stage 1: Environment Setup
```
[1/4] Setting up environment: CartPole-v0
  ✓ Environment ready: seals:seals/CartPole-v0 (8 parallel envs)
```
- Creates vectorized environment for parallel execution
- Wraps with `RolloutInfoWrapper` for demonstration collection

### Stage 2: Expert Loading
```
[2/4] Loading expert policy from HuggingFace
  ✓ Expert loaded | Mean reward: 500.00 ± 0.00
```
- Loads pre-trained expert from HuggingFace Hub
- Expert reward shows the performance goal for GAIL

### Stage 3: Demonstration Collection
```
[3/4] Collecting 60 expert demonstrations
  ✓ Collected 67 episodes, 33500 transitions
```
- Collects expert trajectories (observations, actions, next_obs, done)
- May collect more episodes than requested to reach minimum timesteps
- Transitions = individual (state, action, next_state) tuples

### Stage 4: GAIL Setup
```
[4/4] Setting up GAIL trainer
  ✓ GAIL trainer initialized
  → Minimum training timesteps: 8192
```
- Initializes learner policy (untrained PPO)
- Creates a reward network for GAIL
- Shows minimum timesteps required (auto-calculated)

### Training & Evaluation
```
Training GAIL (100000 steps)
============================================================
Mean reward before GAIL training: 22.45 ± 8.12

Training for 100000 timesteps...

Mean reward after GAIL training: 487.23 ± 15.34
Improvement: +464.78
============================================================
```

**Interpreting results:**
- **Before training**: Random/untrained policy performance (~20-100 for CartPole)
- **After training**: Learned policy performance (should approach expert ~500)
- **Improvement**: Difference showing learning effectiveness
- **Standard deviation (±)**: Variance across evaluation episodes

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ After training ≈ Expert reward (within ~10%)
- ✅ Improvement > 80% of gap between before and expert
- ❌ After training << Expert reward → Need more training steps or demos

# Troubleshooting

### Error: Timesteps too low
```
AssertionError: No updates (need at least 16384 timesteps, have only total_timesteps=10000)!
```

**Solution:** Increase `--gail-steps` to at least the minimum shown in setup:
```bash
python gail_pipeline.py --env CartPole-v0 --gail-steps 20000
```

### Performance doesn't match the expert

**Possible causes:**
1. **Not enough training**: Increase `--gail-steps` (try 1-2M)
2. **Not enough demos**: Increase `--demo-episodes` (try 100+)
3. **Evaluation variance**: Increase `--n-eval-episodes` to 100+




# Advanced: Loading Custom Experts [Under Development]

For environments without pre-trained HuggingFace experts, use the separate loader:

```python
from load_cheetah_expert import train_cheetah_expert

# Train custom expert
expert, env = train_cheetah_expert(
    total_timesteps=1_000_000,
    save_path="my_expert.zip"
)

# Integrate with pipeline
pipeline = GAILPipeline(env_name="HalfCheetah-v3")
pipeline.venv = env
pipeline.expert = expert
pipeline.collect_demonstrations()
pipeline.setup_gail()
pipeline.train_gail()
```

# Key Concepts

### Demo Episodes vs Eval Episodes

- **Demo Episodes** (`--demo-episodes`): Training data for GAIL
  - Used to teach the learner what expert behavior looks like
  - More = better training signal
  
- **Eval Episodes** (`--n-eval-episodes`): Testing/measurement only
  - Used to calculate performance metrics
  - More = more stable/accurate estimates
  - Does NOT affect training

### GAIL Hyperparameters

- **demo_batch_size**: How many expert transitions per batch
  - Larger = more stable discriminator training
  - Should be > 1024 for most environments

- **gen_replay_buffer_capacity**: Buffer size for learner experience
  - Larger = more diverse training data
  - Trade-off with memory usage

- **n_disc_updates**: Discriminator training frequency
  - Higher = better reward learning, but slower
  - Typical range: 8-32
